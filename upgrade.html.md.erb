## <a id="upgrades"></a>Upgrade Redis for PCF

This product enables a reliable upgrade experience between versions of the product that is deployed through Ops Manager.

For information on the upgrade paths for each released version, see the above table.

To upgrade Redis for PCF, do the following:

1. Download the latest version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis).
1. Upload the new `.pivotal` file to Ops Manager.
1. If required, upload the stemcell associated with the update.
1. If required, update any new mandatory configuration parameters.
1. Click **Apply changes**. The rest of the process is automated.

During the upgrade deployment each Redis instance experiences a small period of downtime as each Redis instance is updated with the new software components. This downtime is because the Redis instances are single VMs operating in a non HA setup.

The length of the downtime depends on whether there is a stemcell update to replace the operating system image, or whether the existing VM can simply have the redis software updated. Stemcell updates incur additional downtime while the IaaS creates the new VM, whereas updates without a stemcell update are faster.

Ops Manager ensures the instances are updated with the new packages and any configuration changes are applied automatically.

Upgrading to a newer version of the product does not cause any loss of data or configuration.

##  <a id="downtime"></a> Downtime During Upgrades and Redeploys

A redeploy causes downtime of the Redis for PCF tile. 
This section clarifies what events trigger a redeploy.

### <a id="opsman"></a> Ops Manager Changes

In Ops Manager, any field that changes the manifest causes a redeploy of the Redis for PCF tile.

### <a id="pas"></a> PAS (or Elastic Runtime) Changes

In the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) or Elastic Runtime, changes to any of the following properties can trigger downtime:
<ul>
  <li><code>..cf.consul\_server.ips</code>---Consul Server Resource Config </li>
  <li><code>$runtime.system\_domain</code>---Runtime System Domain </li>
  <li><code>..cf.ha\_proxy.skip\_cert\_verify.value</code>---Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment in PAS (or Elastic Runtime)
</li>
  <li><code>$runtime.apps\_domain</code>---Runtime Apps Domain </li>
  <li><code>..cf.nats.ips</code>---NATS Resource Config
</li>
  <li><code>$self.service\_network</code>---Service Networks in Ops Manager
</li>
</ul>

When the operator applies any of the above changes to PAS (or Elastic Runtime), downtime is triggered for the following:

* Redis On-Demand Broker in Redis for PCF v1.8 and later

* Dedicated-VM and Shared-VM Services in Redis for PCF v1.9 and earlier


### <a id="all-instances"></a> Upgrading all Service Instances

* For Redis for PCF v1.8 and later, downtime for service instances occurs only
after the operator runs the `upgrade-all-service-instances` BOSH errand, after all tile upgrades are completed successfully.

* Any change to a field on the Redis for PCF tile causes BOSH to redeploy both the legacy
and the On-Demand Redis Brokers after the operator runs the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand.


## <a id="network-upgrades"></a> Network Changes after Deployment

This section explains how changing the network after deploying Redis for PCF 
affects instances and apps. 

### <a id="network-upgrades-dedicated-vms"></a> Dedicated VMs

Pivotal discourages changing the network that a pre-existing dedicated-vm deployment works with. 
If the network is changed, app bindings for existing dedicated-vm instances might stop working. 
Also, VMs might be reallocated as new service instances, without their data being cleaned, 
resulting in a data leak between apps.

### <a id="network-upgrades-on-demand"></a> On Demand Service Instances

If the service network Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) range is changed for a tile, 
you must unbind and rebind existing apps to the on-demand Redis instance.

If there are no dedicated-vm instances, it is safe to change the service network. 
New on-demand service instances are placed into the new network, 
but existing on-demand service instances are not moved. 
If you need to move the data in on-demand Redis instances to a new network:
create a new instance, migrate the data manually, and delete the old instance.

Similarly, changing the availability zone for an on-demand plan only applies to new on-demand instances, 
and does not alter existing instances.

## <a id="policy"></a> Release Policy

When a new version of Redis is released, Pivotal aims to release a new version of Redis for PCF containing the new Redis version soon after.

When a new version of Redis or another dependent software component, such as the stemcell, is released due to a critical CVE, Pivotal's goal is to release a new version of the Redis for PCF within 48 hours.
