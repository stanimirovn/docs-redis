## Useful Debugging Information
If you encounter an issue, here is a list of useful information to gather, especially before you perform any destructive operations such as `cf purge-service-offerings` or `bosh delete deployment`.

* PCF Redis version
* Previous PCF Redis version if upgrading
* Ops Manager version, and previous if upgrading Ops Manager
* IaaS description

### From OpsManager:
  * The installation logs
  * A copy of all files in `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments`

### For all VMs, unless specified otherwise:
  * Copy of `/var/vcap/sys/log` (particularly the broker)
  * If unable to get logs from disk, logs from a forwarded endpoint
  * `monit summary`
  * Full `ps aux` - Has monit done its job?
  * `ps aux | grep redis-serve[r]` - Are Redis instances running?
  * `df -h` - disk usage
  * `free -m` - memory usage
  * `cf m`
  * `tree /var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker/redis-data` (broker only)
  * Copy of `/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker/statefile.json` (broker only)
