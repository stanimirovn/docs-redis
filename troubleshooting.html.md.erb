## Useful Debugging Information
If you encounter an issue, here is a list of useful information to gather, especially before you perform any destructive operations such as `cf purge-service-offerings` or `bosh delete deployment`. 

* PCF Redis version
* Previous PCF Redis version if upgrading
* Ops Manager version
* IaaS description
* For all VMs:
  * Copy of /var/vcap/sys/log (particularly the broker)
  * Logs from a forwarded endpoint
  * `monit summary`
  * `Full ps aux` - Has monit done its job?
  * `ps aux | grep redis-serve[r]` - Are Redis instances running?
  * `df -h` - disk usage
  * `free -m` - memory usage
  * `cf m`
  * `tree /var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker/redis-data` (broker only)
  * Copy of /var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker/statefile.json
