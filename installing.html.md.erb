<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the process of installing the Redis for PCF.
It covers tasks from downloading the file from the Pivotal Network
through to verifying the installation after configuration.

## <a id="install"></a>Download and Install the Tile

To add Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) to Ops Manager, follow the procedure for adding PCF Ops Manager tiles:

1. Download the Redis for PCF file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis). 
Select the latest release from the **Releases** drop-down menu.
1. In the PCF Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click **Import a Product** to upload the Redis for PCF file.
1. Click the **+** sign next to the uploaded product description to add the tile to your staging area.
1. To configure Redis for PCF, click the newly added tile.
1. After completing the required configuration, click **Apply Changes** to install the service.

For guidance on ports and ranges used in the Redis service, see [Select Networks](#network-configuration) below.

## <a id="azs"></a>Assign AZs and Networks

To assign AZs and networks, click the **Assign AZs and Networks** settings tab.

![AZ Assignment Diagram](AZ-assignment.png)

###  <a id="az-config"></a>Assign AZs

As of Redis for PCF v1.9, you can assign multiple AZs to Redis jobs, however this does not guarantee high availability.
For more information, see [Support for Multiple AZs](erc.html#other-notes).

To assign AZs, do the following:

1. In the **Assign AZs and Networks** tab, make your selections under **Place singleton jobs in** and **Balance other jobs in**.
1. Click **Save**.


###  <a id="network-configuration"></a>Select Networks

You can use Redis for PCF with or without using the on-demand service.

* **To use the Redis for PCF on-demand service**

    You must use a [service network] (./odnetworking.html#architecture_networks) with the on-demand service. 
    From an IaaS perspective, creating a service network is identical to creating any other network 
    created for tiles on Ops Manager. The only difference is that the operator must mark the 
    network as a “Service Network” in Ops Manager to prevent Ops Manager from performing IP management in that network.

* **To use Redis for PCF without the on-demand service**

    If you want to use Redis for PCF without the on-demand service, you must still create an 
    [empty service network](https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/115010154387) to install the tile.

For more information, see [Networking for On-Demand Services](./odnetworking.html).

To select networks, do the following:

1. In the **Assign AZs and Networks** tab, select a **Network**.<br><br>
    Pivotal recommends that each type of PCF service run in its own network.
    For example, run Redis for PCF on a separate network from RabbitMQ for PCF.

1. If using the on-demand service, select a **Service Network**. 
Otherwise, select an [empty service network](https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/115010154387).

#### Port Ranges Used in Redis for PCF

The following ports and ranges are used in Redis for PCF:

| Port                  | Protocol                     | Direction and Network                                                                          | Reason                                                                                                                      |

##  <a id="service-plans"></a>Configure Redis for PCF Service Plans

Click the Redis for PCF tile in the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard to display the configuration page
and allocate resources to Redis service plans.</br></br>

###  <a id="on-demand-config"></a>On-Demand Service Settings

1. Click **On-Demand Service Settings**, and then enter the **Maximum service instances across all on-demand plans**. 
The maximum number of instances you set for all your on-demand plans combined cannot exceed this number.</br></br>
    ![settings](redis-odservice-settings.png)</br></br>
    For more information, see [Setting Limits for On-Demand Service Instances](./set-quotas.html).

1. Select the **Allow outbound internet access from service instances** checkbox. 
   You must select this checkbox to allow external log forwarding, send backup artifacts to external destinations,
   and communicate with an external BOSH blob store.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Outbound network traffic rules also depend on your IaaS settings.
      Consult your network or IaaS administrator to ensure that your IaaS allows outbound traffic to the external networks you need.</p>

1. To configure an on-demand plan, click **On-Demand Plan 1**, **2**, or **3**.</br></br>

    You can configure up to three on-demand plans with appropriate memory and disk sizes for your use case(s).
    Resource configuration options may vary on different IaaSs.
</br>
</br>
    The default names of the three on-demand plans provided reflect that instances of these plans are intended to be used for different cache sizes:</br></br>
    * **cache-small**: A Redis instance deployed to a dedicated VM, suggested to be configured with ~1&nbsp;GB of memory and >3.5&nbsp;GB of persistent disk
    * **cache-medium**: A Redis instance deployed to a dedicated VM, suggested to be configured with ~2&nbsp;GB of memory and >10&nbsp;GB of persistent disk
    * **cache-large**: A Redis instance deployed to a dedicated VM, suggested to be configured with ~4&nbsp;GB of memory and >14&nbsp;GB of persistent disk</br>

    ![on demand config](on-demand-config.png) <a id="planconfig"></a>
    
1. Configure the following settings for your on-demand plan(s).
   Any pre-populated default settings are pre-configured according to the memory and disk size of each plan.

1.  Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: As of Redis for PCF v1.11,
    the On-Demand service is at feature parity with the Dedicated-VM service.
    The Dedicated-VM service plan will be deprecated.
    Pivotal recommends disabling the Shared-VM and Dedicated-VM service plans.
    See <a href="#disable-shared-dedicated">Disable Shared and Dedicated VM Plans</a> below. </p>

#### <a id="change-on-demand"></a>Updating On-Demand Service Plans

Operators can update certain settings after the plans have been created.
If the operator updates the VM size, disk size, or the Redis configuration settings
(enabling Lua Scripting, max-clients, timeout and TCP keep-alive),
these settings are implemented in all instances that are already created.

Operators should not downsize the VMs or disk size because this can cause data loss in pre-existing instances.
Additionally, operators cannot make a plan that was previously active, inactive, until all instances of that plan have been deleted.

#### <a id="remove-on-demand"></a>Removing On-Demand Service Plans

If you want to remove the On-Demand Service from your tile, do the following: <br/>

1. Go to the **Resource Config** page on the Redis for PCF tile, and set the **Redis On-Demand Broker** job instances to 0.

1. Navigate to the **Errands** page on the Redis for PCF tile, and set the following errands to **off**:
    * Register On-demand Redis Broker
    * On-demand Broker Smoke Tests
    * Upgrade all On-demand Redis Service Instances
    * Deregister On-demand Redis Broker

1. Create an empty service network.
   For instructions, see this [Knowledge Base article](https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/115010154387).

1. Go to each of the three On-Demand Plan pages on the Redis for PCF tile, and set each plan to **Plan Inactive**.
   For example:
  ![cache plan inactive](cache-plan-inactive.png)


###  <a id="shared-vm-config"></a>Shared-VM Plan

1.  Select the **Shared-VM Plan** tab.
![shared vm config](shared-vm-config.png)

1.  Configure these fields:<br><br>
      * **Redis Instance Memory Limit**---Maximum memory used by a shared-VM instance
      * **Redis Service Instance Limit**---Maximum number of shared-VM instances

    Shared-VM instances run on the Redis broker VM, so 
    the memory and instance limits for instances of this plan depend on the total system memory of your Redis broker VM. 
    
    <br>Pivotal recommends you only allow up to 45% of the Redis broker VM's total system memory to be used by all shared-VM instances combined.
    This is due to the amount of memory required to support Redis persistence and to run Redis broker and system tasks.

    <br />To configure the limits in these fields, 
    estimate the maximum memory that could be used by all your Redis shared-VM instances combined. 
    If that figure is higher than 45% of the Redis broker 
    VM's total system memory, you can do one of the following:<br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Decrease the **Redis Instance Memory Limit**.</li>
      <li>Decrease the number of instances in **Redis Service Instance Limit**.</li>
      <li>Increase the RAM for the Redis Broker in the **Resource Config** tab as shown below.
          <img src="./images/redis-broker-resource.png"></li>
    </ul>

    Here are some examples for setting these limits:

    <table border="1" class="nice">
    	<tr>
    		<th>Redis Broker VM Total Memory</th>
    		<th>Redis Instance Memory Limit</th>
    		<th>Redis Service Instance Limit</th>
    	</tr>
    	<tr>
    	 	<td>16&nbsp;GB</td>
    	 	<td>512&nbsp;MB</td>
    	 	<td>14</td>
     	</tr>
      <tr>
    	 	<td>16&nbsp;GB</td>
    	 	<td>256&nbsp;MB</td>
    	 	<td>28</td>
     	</tr>
      <tr>
    	 	<td>64&nbsp;GB</td>
    	 	<td>512&nbsp;MB</td>
    	 	<td>56</td>
     	</tr>
    </table>


    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: It is possible to configure a larger <strong>Redis Service Instance Limit</strong>,
      if you are confident that the majority of the deployed instances will not use a large amount of their allocated memory,
      for example in development or test environments. <br><br>However, doing this is not supported, and can cause your server to run out of memory,
      preventing users from writing any more data to any Redis shared-VM instance.
    </p>

1. Click **Save**.

1. If you do not want to use the on-demand service, you must make all of the on-demand service plans inactive.
Click the tab for each on-demand plan, and select **Plan Inactive**.
See the example in Step 4 of [Removing On-Demand Service Plans](#remove-on-demand) above.

1. To change the allocation of resources for the Redis broker, click the **Resource Config** tab.
    <br><br>The Redis broker server runs all of the Redis instances for your Shared-VM plan.
    From the **Resource Config** page, you can change the CPU, RAM, Ephemeral Disk, and Persistent Disk made available, as needed.

For more information, see [Configure Resources for Shared-VM and Dedicated-VM Plans](#resources) below.

###  <a id="dedicated-vm-config"></a>Dedicated-VM Plan

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: As of Redis for PCF v1.11,
    the On-Demand service is at feature parity with the Dedicated-VM service.
    The Dedicated-VM service plan will be deprecated.
    Pivotal recommends using the On-Demand service plan.
    See <a href="#disable-shared-dedicated">Disable Shared and Dedicated VM Plans</a> below. </p>

1.  To configure the Dedicated-VM plan, click the **Resource Config** tab to change the allocation of resources for the **Dedicated Node**.
<a id="resource-config"></a>![dedicated vm config](dedicated-vm-config.png)
<br>
  - The default configuration creates five dedicated nodes (VMs).
  Each node can run one Redis dedicated-VM instance.
  - You can change the number of dedicated nodes, and configure the size of the
  persistent and ephemeral disks, and the CPU and RAM for each node.
  - The default VM size is small. It is important that you set the correct
  VM size to handle anticipated loads.
  - A Redis dedicated-VM instance is allowed up to 45% of the total system RAM on the VM. You can set this with the `maxmemory` configuration.
  The app can use 100% of `maxmemory`, that is, up to 45% of the system RAM.
  - Pivotal recommends the persistent disk be set to 3.5x the amount of system RAM.

1. Click **Save**.


1. If you do not want to use the on-demand service, you must make all of the on-demand service plans inactive.
Click the tab for each on-demand plan, and select **Plan Inactive**.
See the example in Step 4 of [Removing On-Demand Service Plans](#remove-on-demand) above.

For more information on configuring resources, see below.

### <a id="resources"></a>Configure Resources for Shared-VM and Dedicated-VM Plans

To configure resources for the Shared-VM and Dedicated-VM plans, click the **Resource Config** settings tab on the Redis for PCF tile.

* The Shared-VM plan is on the **Redis Broker** resource.
* The Dedicated-VM plan is on the **Dedicated Node** resource.

The following are the default resource and IP requirements for Redis for PCF when using the Shared-VM or Dedicated-VM plans:
<table border="1" class="nice">

### <a id="disable-shared-dedicated" ></a>Disable Shared and Dedicated VM Plans

You can disable Shared and Dedicated VM Plans by doing the following while configuring Redis tile:

* In the 'Shared-VM Plan' tab, set 'Redis Service instance Limit' to 0.
* Ensure at least one On-Demand plan is active.
* In the 'Errands' tab:
  * Set 'Broker Registrar' to Off
  * Set 'Smoke Tests' to Off
  * Set 'Broker Deregistrar' to Off
  * Leave all four On-Demand errands On.
* In the 'Resource Config' tab
  * Set 'Dedicated Node' instances to 0.
  * Decrease 'Redis Broker' Persistent disk type to the smallest size available.
  * Decrease 'Redis Broker' VM type to the smallest size available.


### <a id="configurations"></a>Additional Redis Configurations

You can update certain plan settings after the plans have been created.
If you update the VM size, disk size, or the Redis configuration settings (enabling Lua Scripting, max-clients, timeout and TCP keep-alive),
these settings are implemented in all instances already created.
You must not downsize the VMs or disk size because this can cause data loss in pre-existing instances.

The following table describes properties you can update in the [plan configuration page](#planconfig), shown above.

<table border="1" class="nice">
  <tr>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Default</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Redis Client Timeout</strong></td>
    <td>3600</td>
    <td>Server timeout for an idle client specified in seconds (e.g., 3600)</td>

## <a id="syslog"></a>Configure Syslog Forwarding

Pivotal recommends that operators configure syslog forwarding to a remote destination.
Forwarding your system logs to a remote destination lets you:

* View logs from every VM in the Redis for PCF deployment in one place.
* Effectively troubleshooting when logs are lost on the source VM.
* Set up alerts for important error logs to monitor the deployment.

All logs follow RFC5424 format.

To configure syslog forwarding, do the following:

1. Click the Redis for PCF tile to display the configuration page, and then click the **Syslog** tab.

    <br>![syslog configuration](syslog-forwarding5.png)

1. Select either **Yes without encryption** or **Yes with TLS encryption**.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To use syslog forwarding for on-demand instances,
       you must select the <a href="#on-demand-config"> Allow outbound internet access from service instances</a> 
       checkbox in the <strong>On-Demand Service Settings</strong> tab.</p>

1. Enter the Syslog **Address** and **Port**, and select the **Transport protocol** of your remote destination.
   You can only use TCP if you are using TLS encryption.<br><br>
   The information required for these fields is provided by your remote destination.
   **Address** should be something such as `logs.papertrailapp.com`, and **Port** will be a number such as `41635`.

1. Select the format for your logs. [RFC5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424) is the suggested format.<br><br>
   For instances of the Redis on-demand plan, all logs follow RFC5424 format.
   Instances of the Dedicated-VM and Shared-VM plans allow for the operator to select their log format to be either their legacy format or RFC5424.
   PCF is moving toward all syslogs consistently using RFC5424 format.

1. If you selected **Yes with TLS encryption**, complete these fields:<br><br>
  * **Permitted Peer** refers to the remote syslog destination.
    It allows each VM to establish an encrypted tunnel with the remote syslog destination. 
  The Permitted Peer is either the accepted fingerprint (SHA1) or name of the remote peer, for example `*.example.com`.
  * **TLS CA certificate** refers to the trusted certificate authorities for the remote syslog destination.
    Large certificate chains (> 8&nbsp;kb) are not supported.

1.  Click **Save**.


## <a id="apply"></a> Apply Changes from Your Configuration

Your installation is not complete until you apply your configuration changes.
Follow the steps below:

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

2. Click **Apply Changes**.


##  <a id="asg"></a> Create Application Security Groups

To allow this service to have network access, 
you must create [Application Security Groups (ASGs)](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-10/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html). 
Ensure your security group allows access to the Redis Service Broker VM and Dedicated VMs configured in your deployment. 
You can obtain the IP addresses for these VMs in Ops Manager under the <strong>Resource Config</strong> section for the Redis for PCF tile.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Without ASGs, this service is unusable.</p>

### Application Container Network Connections

Application containers that use instances of the Redis for PCF service require the following outbound network connections:

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Destination</th>
<th>Ports</th>
<th>Protocol</th>
<th>Reason</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>ASSIGNED_NETWORK</code></td>
<td>32768-61000</td>
<td>tcp</td>
<td>Enable application to access shared vm service instance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>ASSIGNED_NETWORK</code></td>
<td>6379</td>
<td>tcp</td>
<td>Enable application to access dedicated vm service instance</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

Create an ASG called `redis-app-containers` with the above configuration and bind it to the appropriate space or, 
to give all started apps access, bind to the `default-running` ASG set and restart your apps. Example:

```json
[
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "ASSIGNED_NETWORK",
    "ports": "6379"
  }
]
```
