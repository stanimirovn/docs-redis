#### Notes:
* The `shared-vm` plan is on the `Redis Broker` resource
* The `dedicated-vm` plan is on the `Dedicated Node` resource

## <a id="configuration"></a>Configuring PCF Redis

###  <a id="service-plans"></a>Configure Redis Service Plans
 
Select the **Redis** tile from the Installation Dashboard to display the configuration page and allocate resources to Redis service plans.

####  <a id="shared-vm-config"></a>Shared-VM Plan 

1.  Select the **Shared-VM Plan** tab to configure the memory limit for each Redis instance and the maximum number of instances that can be created.
![shared vm config](shared-vm-config.png)

1.  Enter the maximum number of instances and the memory limit for each Redis instance.

1.  Click the **Save** button.

    <br />Shared-VM instances run on the Redis Broker.

    <br />The memory and instance limits for your Shared-VM Redis instances should depend on the total memory of your Redis broker.
    When configuring the maximum number of Redis service instances that can be created you need to take into account the maximum memory each redis instance could use in correlation with how much total memory the Redis broker has.
    We recommend you only allow up to 45% of your Redis broker's total memory to be used by all Redis instances.
    This is due the amount of memory required to support Redis persistence, and run Redis broker & system tasks.

    <br />See below for example cases:

    <table border="1" class="nice">
    	<tr>
    		<th>Redis Broker Total Memory</th>
    		<th>Redis Instance Memory Limit</th>
    		<th>Redis Service Instance Limit</th>
    	</tr>
    	<tr>
    	 	<td>16GB</td>
    	 	<td>512MB</td>
    	 	<td>14</td>
     	</tr>
      <tr>
    	 	<td>16GB</td>
    	 	<td>256MB</td>
    	 	<td>28</td>
     	</tr>
      <tr>
    	 	<td>64GB</td>
    	 	<td>512MB</td>
    	 	<td>56</td>
     	</tr>
    </table>


    <br />It is possible to configure a larger Redis Service Instance Limit, if you are confident that the majority of the deployed instances will not be using a large amount of their allocated memory, for example in development or test environments.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
      This is not supported, and could cause your server to run out of memory.
      If this happens your users may not be able to write any further data to any Redis instance.
    </p>


1.  Select the **Resource Config** tab to change the allocation of resources for the Redis Broker.
    <br />The Redis Broker server will run all of the Redis instances for your Shared-VM plan. From this screen you may increase or decrease the CPU, RAM, Ephemeral Disk & Persistent Disk made available, as required.

1.  Click the **Save** button.

####  <a id="dedicated-vm-config"></a>Dedicated-VM Plan

1.  Select the **Resource Config** tab to change the allocation of resources for the Dedicated Node.
![dedicated vm config](dedicated-vm-config.png)

    <br />By default, 5 dedicated nodes will be created, each capable of running one Redis instance. You can increase or decrease the number of dedicated nodes, the size of the Persistent and Ephemeral Disks, and the CPU and RAM, as required.
The default VM size is small; it is important that the operator set the correct VM size to handle anticipated loads. Redis maxmemory is set to 45% of RAM. It is recommended the persistent disk be set to 3.5x the amount of RAM. 

1.  Click the **Save** button.


### <a id="syslog"></a>Configure Syslog Output

Pivotal recommends that operators configure a syslog output.

1.  Add the Syslog address, Syslog port and transport protocol of your log management tool.

    The information required for these fields is provided by your log management tool.

    ![syslog configuration](syslog-forwarding.png)

1.  Click the **Save** button.


### <a id="backup"></a>Configure Backups 

You can configure backups to be run for all instances, across both service plans.

The key features are:

* Runs at midnight system time every day (not configurable)
* Every instance is backed up, across both service plans
* You can configure an S3 compatible blobstore as your destination
* Data from Redis is flushed to disk, before the backup is started by running a `BGSAVE` on each instance
* Currently certified and tested against AWS S3 only

#### Configuration
To enable backups to be taken, you need to configure the mandatory options in the `Redis for PCF` tile in OpsManager.

Click on the tile in OpsManager, followed by the `Backups` link on the left hand menu.

![View of OpsManager Backup configuration](backups.jpeg)

##### Access Key ID
This is your Access Key for your Blobstore

**Required?** No - this is optional, dependent upon whether it is required by your blobstore

##### Secret Access Key
This is your Secret associated with your access key id

**Required?** No - this is optional, dependent upon whether it is required by your blobstore

##### Endpoint URL
This is the endpoint for your blobstore e.g. `https://s3.amazonaws.com`

**Required?** Yes - If you want to enable backups to be run, you must populate this field.

##### Bucket Name
Name of the bucket inside your blobstore you wish the files to be stored in.

**Required?** Yes - If you want to enable backups to be run, you must populate this field.

##### Path
Path inside the bucket

**Required?** No - this is optional.

#### Redis BGSAVE Timeout
This is the amount of time that the backup process will wait for the BGSAVE command to complete on your instance, before transferring the RDB file to your configured blobstore.

You can increase this if required for your setup.

**Required?** - Yes, this defaults to 600 seconds.

#### AWS IAM Policy
The minimum set of policies required in order to upload the backup files are:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:CreateBucket",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
Make sure to replace `<bucket-name>` with your correct value.

### <a id="azs"></a>Networks, Security, and Assigning AZs 
                 
####  <a id="network-configuration"></a>Network Configuration

The following ports and ranges are used in this service:

* Destination port 80 access to the service broker from the cloud controllers
* Destination port 6379 access to all dedicated nodes from the Diego Cell and Diego Brain network(s)
* Destination ports 32768 to 61000 on the service broker from the Diego Cell and Diego Brain network(s). This is only required for the shared service plan.
* Outbound access to your chosen blobstore, typically HTTP 80 or HTTPS 443

####  <a id="asg"></a> Application Security Groups###

To allow this service to have network access you must create [Application Security Groups (ASGs)](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html). Ensure your security group allows access to the Redis Service Broker VM and Dedicated VMs configured in your deployment. You can obtain the IP addresses for these VMs in Ops Manager under the <strong>Resource Config</strong> section for the Redis tile.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Without ASGs, this service is unusable.</p>

##### Application Container Network Connections 

Application containers that use instances of the Redis service require the following outbound network connections:

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Destination</th>
<th>Ports</th>
<th>Protocol</th>
<th>Reason</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>ASSIGNED_NETWORK</code></td>
<td>32768-61000</td>
<td>tcp</td>
<td>Enable application to access shared vm service instance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>ASSIGNED_NETWORK</code></td>
<td>6379</td>
<td>tcp</td>
<td>Enable application to access dedicated vm service instance</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

Create an ASG called `redis-app-containers` with the above configuration and bind it to the appropriate space or, to give all started apps access, bind to the `default-running` ASG set and restart your apps. Example:

```json
[
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "<code>ASSIGNED_NETWORK</code>",
    "ports": "6379"
  }
]
```  

####  <a id="az-config"></a>Assigning AZs
Assigning multiple AZs to Redis jobs will not guarantee high availability.

All of your Shared-VM instances will run on a single node in just one of the configured availability zones and are therefore not highly availabile.

Each Dedicated-VM instance could be assigned to any of the configured availability zones, however each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering. This separation over availability zones provides no high availability.

## <a id="validation"></a>Validating Installation

### Smoke tests

Smoke tests are run as part of Redis for PCF installation to validate that the install succeeded. Smoke tests are described <a href="/redis/1-6/smoke-tests.html">here</a>.
                
## <a id="upgrades"></a>Upgrading Redis for PCF

This product enables a reliable upgrade experience between versions of the product that is deployed through Ops Manager.

The upgrade paths are detailed [here](http://docs.pivotal.io/redis/1-6/index.html) for each released version.

To upgrade the product:

* The Operator should download the latest version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis)
* Upload the new .pivotal file to Ops Manager
* Upload the stemcell associated with the update (*if required*)
* Update any new mandatory configuration parameters (*if required*)
* Press "Apply changes" and the rest of the process is automated

During the upgrade deployment each Redis instance will experience a small period of downtime as each Redis instance is updated with the new software components. This downtime is because the Redis instances are single VMs operating in a non HA setup. The length of the downtime depends on whether there is a stemcell update to replace the operating system image or whether the existing VM can simply have the redis software updated. Stemcells updates incur additional downtime while the IaaS creates the new VM while updates without a stemcell update are faster.

Ops Manager ensures the instances are updated with the new packages and any configuration changes are applied automatically.

Upgrading to a newer version of the product does not cause any loss of data or configuration. This is explicitly tested for during our build and test process for a new release of the product.

### Release policy

When a new version of Redis is released we aim to release a new version of the product containing this soon after.

Where there is a new version of Redis or another dependent software component such as the stemcell released due to a critical CVE, Pivotal's goal is to release a new version of the product within 48 hours.
