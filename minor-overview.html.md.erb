This topic describes the significant new features in Redis for PCF v1.7.
This topic also presents a checklist that you can use to decide if Redis for PCF is ready to meet your business requirements.

##<a id="intro"></a> Introduction

Redis for PCF v1.7 focuses on enhanced backup and restore capabilities.  Operators can configure a schedule for backups, as well as a several options for where to put the backup artifacts.
The release also includes scripts that can be run by the operator to back up and restore dedicated-vm or shared-vm service instances. Redis for PCF 1.7 is configured as a datastore, if you wish to use Redis as a cache, please upgrade to Redis for PCF 1.8.

## <a id="features"></a>New in This Release

The following features are new in Redis for PCF v1.7

+ <strong>A choice of destinations for backup artifacts</strong> — Redis for PCF v1.7 can send backup artifacts to AWS S3, SCP, Azure or Google Cloud Storage
+ <strong>Scripts for manual backup and restore</strong> — Redis for PCF v1.7 includes scripts for backing up and restoring dedicated and shared VM instances.
+ <strong>Operator configured backup schedule</strong> — The operator can configure a `cron` schedule for triggering backups.

### Known Issues
+ Upgrade from 1.6 sometimes fails at cf-redis-broker. Clicking `apply changes` again will successfully complete upgrade.
+ Backup configuration is not preserved when upgrading from PCF Redis 1.5 or 1.6; if backing up to AWS S3, operators will need to re-enter S3 configuration.
+ The service broker and all shared-vm service instances are unavailable while the manual restore script is being run.
+ If the manual restore script fails, the Redis service instance that is being restored to is left in an unusable state.
+ The manual restore script can time out on very large files, e.g. larger than 60GB.
+ The Redis broker vm instance listens on port 12350 instead of port 80. Any vms that need to communicate to the broker (e.g. broker-registrar, cloud_controller) should have this port open.
Please ensure you have the appropriate firewall settings.

## <a id="other-notes"></a>About Multiple AZs in Redis for PCF v1.7

Redis for PCF v1.7 supports configuring multiple AZs.
However, assigning multiple AZs to Redis jobs does not guarantee high availability.

+ Shared-VM instances run on a single node in just one of the configured availability zones and are therefore not highly available.
+ Dedicated-VM instances can be assigned to any of the configured availability zones.
However each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering.
This separation over availability zones provides no high availability.
