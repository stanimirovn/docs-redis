## <a id="triggering"></a>Triggering a Manual Backup

Backups of your Redis deployment will automatically occur per the Cron Schedule you set in your deployment. You can trigger manual backups at any time by following the steps below. The backup artifacts will be sent to the destination configured in Ops Manager for automatic backups. 

* [Follow these steps](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh) to log into your Ops Manager installation and target the Redis tile deployment.
* Identify the VM which holds your instance by running `bosh vms`.
  * For the `shared-vm` plan this will be the job name containing `cf-redis-broker`. Running `manual-backup` will back up all of the shared-vm instances and the broker state in the `statefile.json` file. 
  * For the `dedicated-vm` plan this will be the job name containing `dedicated-node`. Running `manual-backup` will back up the Redis dump.rdb file for that dedicated-vm instance.
  * You can identify the exact node for your `dedicated-vm` service instance by comparing the IP Address from your application bindings.

An example output from `bosh vms`:

* Target the manifest of your deployed Redis with `bosh deployment PATH-TO-MANIFEST.yml`. If you do not have this file, you can download it by running `bosh download manifest DEPLOYMENT-NAME`.
* `bosh ssh` into the node you wish to back up (or the `cf-redis-broker` node in a `shared-vm` plan).

Once you have connected to the node, a manual backup can be triggered with these steps:

1. Switch to root using `sudo -i`.
1. Run `/var/vcap/jobs/service-backup/bin/manual-backup`

#### Notes

Triggering a manual backup of a large dump.rdb could take sufficiently long that your SSH connection will timeout. Ensure that you have given yourself enough of a timeout to complete the backup.

## Making Your Own Backups

It is possible to create a back up of a Redis instance by hand, bypassing the automated backup tool altogether.

Persistence is enabled on these plans through the use of `RDB` files, using the following Redis config rules:
<pre class=terminal>
save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000
</pre>

### Shared-VM Plan

You can either take the latest RDB file held on disk, which is generated by the above the rules, or trigger a recent update by using the `redis-cli` to trigger a `BGSAVE`. Credentials to log into the `redis-cli` can be obtained from `VCAP_SERVICES` for your bound application.

The `redis-cli` is located in `/var/vcap/packages/redis/bin/redis-cli`.

On this plan, the `BGSAVE` command is aliased to a random string. This can be obtained from Ops Manager in the credentials tab.

#### Steps to Backup

1. `bosh ssh` into your desired node. See the above section on [identifying the correct VM](#triggering).
1. Change to root using `sudo -i`.
1. Copy the contents of the `/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker` directory to a .zip or .tar file.
1. Backup the folder / compressed file to your chosen location.

The `/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker` has sub-directories for each instance created of this plan. The backup file for each instance is called `dump.rdb`.

For example, here are two instances:
<pre class=terminal>
root@66358f3e-3428-46df-9bb3-9acc7770b188:/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker# find -type f | xargs ls -1
./redis-data/3124f373-e9e2-44e1-ad12-a8865d8978b0/db/dump.rdb
./redis-data/3124f373-e9e2-44e1-ad12-a8865d8978b0/redis.conf
./redis-data/3124f373-e9e2-44e1-ad12-a8865d8978b0/redis-server.pid
./redis-data/62333bf9-f023-4566-b233-6686f26b8f4d/db/dump.rdb
./redis-data/62333bf9-f023-4566-b233-6686f26b8f4d/redis.conf
./redis-data/62333bf9-f023-4566-b233-6686f26b8f4d/redis-server.pid
./statefile.json
</pre>

### Dedicated-VM Plan

You can either take the latest RDB file on disk, as generated by the above rules, or trigger a more recent RDB file by executing the `BGSAVE` command using the `redis-cli`. Credentials can be obtained from the `VCAP_SERVICES` from your bound application.
The `redis-cli` can be found in `/var/vcap/packages/redis/bin/redis-cli`.

#### Steps to Backup

* `bosh ssh` into your desired node. See the above section on [identifying the correct VM](#triggering).
* Change to root using `sudo -i`.
* Copy the contents of the `/var/vcap/store/redis` directory to a .zip or .tar file.
* Backup the folder / compressed file to your chosen location.

The backup file will be named `dump.rdb`.

## <a id="restore"></a>Restore Redis Instance from a Backup

### To a Local System
You can choose to restore the RDB file to a local Redis instance.

The steps to do this depend on your configuration and setup.
Refer to the [Redis documentation](http://redis.io/documentation) for more details.

### To Pivotal Cloud Foundry

You can also restore your backup file to another instance of the `Redis for PCF` tile.

#### Prerequisites

* Same resource configuration as the instance from which you backed up.
* Ensure that the persistent disk is large enought to accommodate the temporary files used during the restore process. It should be **3.5x the amount of RAM in the VM**. 

To restore your backup file to another instance of a `Redis for PCF` tile service instance:

1. Create a new instance of the plan that you wish to restore to.
1. Identify the VM which the instance of your plan is located on by following the steps from the `Manual Backups` section above. If you are restoring an instance of `shared-vm`, this VM is the broker VM.
1. `bosh ssh` into the identified VM. This is the broker VM if restoring a `shared-vm` instance.

`Redis for PCF` version 1.7 and later provides a script to automatically restore data in a newly provisioned Redis instance.

#### Preparation
1. Transfer your backup RDB file to a local path on the VM (`PATH-TO-RDB-BACKUP-ON-VM` has to be under `/var/vcap/store`.
1. To verify that the RDB file hasn't been corrupted, run `md5sum PATH-TO-RDB-BACKUP-ON-VM` and compare it against the contents of the `.md5` file named after the backup file. The values should be the same. The `.md5` file is located in the same bucket as the original backup file.
1. Switch to root user `sudo su`

### Dedicated-VM Plan
The restore script will restore the data for the specified dedicated-vm instance. 

#### Execution
1. Run `/var/vcap/jobs/redis-backups/bin/restore --sourceRDB PATH-TO-RDB-BACKUP-ON-VM`.
1. Tail the script logs at `/var/vcap/sys/log/redis-backups/redis-backups.log` to see progress. When the data restore has been successfully completed, you will see the message `Redis data restore completed successfully`.

#### Debugging

The data restore script runs the steps listed below. It logs its process along the way and provides helpful messages in case of failure.

The script logs at `/var/vcap/sys/log/redis-backups/redis-backups.log`. <br />
If a step has failed, resolve the reason that caused it to fail and execute the failed step and every next step manually.
You can retrieve `{instance_password}` through the binding to your service instance: `cf service-key {instance_name} {key_name}`

1. **`StopAll`** <br />

Run `/var/vcap/packages/redis/bin/redis-cli -a {instance_password} BGREWRITEAOF`
1. **`RewriteAOF`** <br />
Run `watch "/var/vcap/packages/redis/bin/redis-cli -a {instance_password} INFO | grep aof_rewrite_in_progress"` until `aof_rewrite_in_progress` is `0`
1. **`StopAll`** <br />
Run `monit stop all`
1. **`WaitForStop`** <br />

## <a id="recovery"></a>Recovering Redis Instances

In the event of a recovery of Cloud Foundry, it is possible to recover bound
Redis instances to healthy states that are in sync with Cloud Foundry. There are
a few caveats to being able to recover previous instance state fully that
depend on your plan.

### Shared-VM Plan Caveats

* You need a backed up RDB Redis dump file - this would be stored in your S3
buckets if you have backups configured
* You need a backed up `/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker/redis-data` directory
from the service broker node (you do not need to backup and `*.aof` or
`*.rdb` files from subdirectories if you have backups configured)

### Dedicated-VM Plan Caveats

* You need a backed up RDB Redis dump file - this would be stored in your S3
buckets if you have backups configured
* You need a backed up `/var/vcap/store/redis/statefile.json` from the service
broker node

### Note

This procedure assumes that a recovery of service information and service keys
assigned to instances are restored with a restore of Cloud Foundry.

### Recovery Procedure

After redeploying Redis, take the following steps.

#### Shared-VM Plan

1. `bosh ssh` into the service broker node of your Redis deployment
1. Run `monit stop all && pkill redis-server`
1. Wait for monit services to enter the `not monitored` state, you can watch
this with `watch monit summary`
1. Confirm no running instances of `redis-server` with
`ps aux | grep redis-server`
1. Copy the backed up `redis-data` directory into `/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker`
1. Follow the instructions [here](#restore) for your plan, skipping the first
four steps described here, for restoring your backed up Redis data
1. Your Redis instance is now recovered

#### Dedicated-VM Plan

1. `bosh ssh` into the service broker node of your Redis deployment
1. Run `monit stop all`
1. Wait for monit services to enter the `not monitored` state, you can watch
this with `watch monit summary`
1. Copy the backed up `/var/vcap/store/cf-redis-broker/statefile.json` and
ensure ownership and permissions are correct with
`chown vcap:vcap /var/vcap/store/redis/dump.rdb && chmod 660 /var/vcap/store/redis/dump.rdb`
1. Follow the instructions [here](#restore) for your plan, skipping the first three steps
described here, for restoring your backed up Redis data
1. Your Redis instance is now recovered
