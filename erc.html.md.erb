title: Is Redis for PCF right for your enterprise?

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic provides recommended use cases for Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)
and information for determining the product's fit for your enterprise's use case.

## <a id="usecases"></a> Recommended Use Cases

On-Demand plans are configured by default for cache use cases but can also be used
as a datastore.

Dedicated-VM and Shared-VM plans are designed for datastore use cases.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Shared-VM service should only be used for development and testing.
   Do not use for production.</p>

<%= partial 'breaking-change-upgrades' %>

Redis can be used in many different ways, including:

* Key/value store: For strings and more complex data structures including Hashes, Lists, Sets, and Sorted Sets
* Session cache: Persistence enabled preservation of state
* Full page cache: Persistence enabled preservation of state
* Database cache: Middle-tier database caching to speed up common queries
* Data ingestion: Because Redis is in memory, it can ingest data very quickly
* Message queues: List and set operations. `PUSH`, `POP`, and blocking queue commands.
* Leaderboards and counting: Increments and decrements sets and sorted sets
  using `ZRANGE`, `ZADD`, `ZREVRANGE`, `ZRANK`, `INCRBY`, and `GETSET`
* Pub/Sub: Built in publish and subscribe operations: `PUBLISH`, `SUBSCRIBE`, and `UNSUBSCRIBE`

## <a id="benchmarks"></a> SLO Benchmark

The Redis for PCF team maintains a monthly Service Level Objective (SLO) of 99.95%
uptime for the Redis for PCF offering on Pivotal Web Services.
This is provided as a benchmark. SLOs for separate offerings of the Redis for
PCF service vary based on variables such as infrastructure, networking, and
relevant policies around security upgrades.

## <a id="offerings"></a> Service Offerings

For descriptions of the Redis for PCF service offerings, see:

* [On-Demand Service Offering](./architecture.html)
* [Shared-VM Service Offering](./architecture-pp.html)

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The Shared-VM plan is not recommended for production use.</li>
    <li>The Dedicated-VM plan is removed in v2.0.</li>
    <li>If you have any dedicated-VM instances you must migrate to the on-demand service plan before upgrading to Redis for PCF v2.0.

##<a id="checklist"></a> Enterprise-Readiness Checklist

Review the following table to determine if Redis for PCF has the features needed to support your enterprise.

<table border="1" class="nice">

  <tr><th colspan=2>Resilience</th><th>More Information</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Availability</td>
    <td>All Redis for PCF services are single nodes without clustering capabilities.
        This means that planned maintenance jobs (e.g., upgrades) can result in 2–10 minutes of downtime,
        depending on the nature of the upgrade.
        Unplanned downtime (e.g., VM failure) also affects the Redis service.<br>
        Redis for PCF has been used successfully in enterprise-ready apps that can tolerate downtime.
        Pre-existing data is not lost during downtime with the default persistence configuration.
        Successful apps include those where the downtime is passively handled or
        where the app handles failover logic.

    For the On-Demand service, the operator does this by creating plans with specific VM sizes and quotas for each plan.
    For the Shared-VM service, the number and size of VMs are pre-provisioned by the operator.
    BOSH errands used for registration, upgrade and cleanup use short-lived VMs that cannot be configured but can be
    turned on or off.

    For the On-Demand Service, the operator can configure three plans with different resource sizes.
    The operator can also scale up the VM size associated with the plan.
    Additionally, the operator can increase the quota, which caps the number of instances allowed for each On-Demand plan.
    To prevent data loss, only scaling up is supported.
    For the Shared-VM Service, the operators can change the Redis instance memory limit as well as change the instance limit.
    To prevent data loss, only scaling up is supported.

    effective troubleshooting when logs are lost on the source VM,
    and setting up alerts for important error logs to monitor the deployment.

### <a id="other-notes"></a>Support for Multiple AZs

Redis for PCF supports configuring multiple availability zones (AZs).
However, assigning multiple AZs to Redis instances does not guarantee high availability as clustered Redis is not supported.
Redis instances operate as single nodes.

+ On-Demand plans can be configured to deploy instances to any AZ.
+ Shared-VM instances run on a single node in the AZ in which the tile is deployed.
