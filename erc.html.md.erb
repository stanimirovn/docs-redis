<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic provides recommended use cases for Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)
and information for determining the product's enterprise-readiness for your enterprise.

## <a id="usecases"></a> Recommended Use Cases

On-Demand plans, introduced in Redis for PCF v1.8, are configured by default for cache use cases.
Dedicated-VM and Shared-VM plans are designed for datastore use cases.

Redis can be used in many different ways, including:

* Key/value store: For strings and more complex data structures including Hashes, Lists, Sets, and Sorted Sets
* Session cache: Persistence enables preservation of state
* Full page cache: Persistence enables preservation of state
* Database cache: Cache queries
* Data ingestion: Because Redis is in memory, it can ingest data very quickly
* Message Queues: List and set operations. `PUSH`, `POP`, and blocking queue commands.
* Leaderboards and Counting: Increments and decrements of sets and sorted sets
  using `ZRANGE`, `ZADD`, `ZREVRANGE`, `ZRANK`, `INCRBY`, and `GETSET`
* Pub/Sub: Built in publish and subscribe operations: `PUBLISH`, `SUBSCRIBE`, and `UNSUBSCRIBE`

Successful use cases handle the downtime that occurs with the Redis for PCF service.
This happens in two ways:
+ For use cases with lower availability requirements, write simple failover logic that enables the app to work while Redis for PCF is down.
+ For use cases with higher availability requirements, write more complex failover logic that enables the app to failover to another singleton Redis for PCF instance.

Review the following table to determine if Redis for PCF has the features needed to support your enterprise.

<table border="1" class="nice">

  <tr><th colspan=2>Resilience</th><th>More Information</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Availability</td>
    <td>All Redis for PCF services are single nodes without clustering capabilities.
        This means that during upgrades can result in 2–10 minutes of downtime,
        depending on the nature of the upgrade.
        Unplanned downtime affects the Redis service.<br>
        Redis for PCF has been used successfully in enterprise-ready apps that can tolerate downtime.
        Pre-existing data is not lost during downtime with the default persistence configuration.
        Successful apps include those where the downtime is passively handled by the app or
        apps designed as anti-fragile in which the failover logic is written to minimize downtime.

### <a id="other-notes"></a>Support for Multiple AZs

Redis for PCF supports configuring multiple availability zones (AZs).
However, assigning multiple AZs to Redis jobs does not guarantee high availability.

+ On-Demand plans can be assigned to any of the configured AZs.
However, each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering.
+ Shared-VM instances run on a single node in just one of the configured AZs and are therefore not highly available.
+ Dedicated-VM instances can be assigned to any of the configured AZs.
However, each instance still operates as a single node with no clustering.
This separation over AZs provides no high availability.
