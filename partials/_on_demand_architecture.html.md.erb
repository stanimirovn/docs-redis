On-demand <%= vars.product_short %> services use BOSH to dynamically deploy VMs and create single-tenant
service instances in a dedicated network.
On-demand services use the dynamically-provisioned service network to host single-tenant worker VMs.
These worker VMs run as service instances within development spaces.

This on-demand architecture has the following advantages:

+ Developers can provision IaaS resources for their services instances when the instances are created.
This removes the need for operators to pre-provision a fixed amount of IaaS resources
when they deploy the service broker.
+ Service instances run on a dedicated VM and do not share VMs with unrelated processes.
This removes the "noisy neighbor" problem, where an app monopolizes resources on a shared cluster.
+ Single-tenant services can support regulatory compliances where
sensitive data must be separated across different machines.

An on-demand service separates operations between the default network and the
service network. Shared service components, such as executive controllers and databases,
Cloud Controller, UAA, and other on-demand components, run on the default network.
Worker pools deployed to specific spaces run on the service network.


The diagram below shows worker VMs in an on-demand service instance
running on a separate services network, while other components run on the default
network.
