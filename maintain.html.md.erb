This topic is for PCF operators. It introduces some best practices, but does not provide details about operation.

## <a id="usecases"></a> Recommended Use Cases

Redis for PCF can be used as a cache or as a datastore.
On-Demand plans, introduced in Redis for PCF v1.8, are configured by default for cache use cases.
Dedicated-VM and Shared-VM plans are designed for datastore use cases.

Redis can be used in many different ways, including:

* Key/value store for strings and more complex data structures including Hashes, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets
* Session cache: persistence enables preservation of state
* Full page cache: persistence enables preservation of state
* Database cache: cache queries
* Data ingestion: because Redis is in memory it can ingest data very quickly
* Message Queues: list and set operations. `PUSH`, `POP`, and blocking queue commands.
* Leaderboards/Counting: increments and decrements of sets and sorted sets using `ZRANGE`, `ZADD`, `ZREVRANGE`, `ZRANK`, `INCRBY`, `GETSET`
* Pub/Sub: built in publish and subscribe operations: `PUBLISH`, `SUBSCRIBE`, `UNSUBSCRIBE`


## <a id="Best Practice"></a>Best Practices

Pivotal recommends that operators follow these guidelines:

* **Resource Allocation**---Work with app developers to anticipate memory requirements and to configure VM sizes.
    Instances of Dedicted-VM and Shared-VM services have identical VM sizes.
    However, with the On-Demand service, app developers can choose from three different plans, each with its own VM size and quota.
* **Logs**---Configure a syslog output.
    Storing logs in an external service helps operators debug issues both current and historical.
* **Monitoring**---Set up a monitoring dashboard for metrics to track the health of the installation.
    On-Demand instances do not yet have instance-level metrics in v1.8+.
* **Backing Up Data**---When using Redis for persistence, configure automatic backups so that data can be restored in an emergency.
    Validate the backed-up data with a test restore.
    On-Demand instances are configured for cache uses and are not intended for backups.
* **Using**---Instances of the On-Demand and Dedicated-VM services run on dedicated VMs.
    Apps in production should have a dedicated instance to prevent performance issues caused by sharing an instance.
    The Shared-VM service does not provide a Dedicated-VM per instance,
    and Pivotal recommends that you only use it for development and testing.

## Resource Usage Planning for On-Demand plans

<p class="note">
Redis On-Demand plans use dedicated VMs and disks, which will consume IaaS resources. Operators can limit resource usage with Plan Quotas and a Global Quota, but resource usage will vary based on number of On-Demand instances provisioned.
</p>

If the number of on-demand instances is greater than or equal to the Global Quota set on the 'On Demand Service Settings' page, no new instances can be provisioned.

To calculate the maximum cost/ usage for each plan:

<pre>max_plan_resources = plan_quota x plan_resources</pre>

To calculate the maximum cost across plans, add together the cost/ usage for each plan, while the quotas sum to less than the global quota.

<pre>
While (plan_1_quota + plan_2_quota) ≤ global_quota:
max_resources = (plan_1_quota x plan_1_resources) + ( plan_2_quota x plan_2_resources)
</pre>

To calculate the current IaaS cost/ usage across On-Demand plans:

1. Current instances provisioned for all plans can be found by referencing the `total_instance` metric as [documented here](monitoring.html#usage)
1. Multiple the `total_instance` for each plan by that plan's resources. Sum all plans that are active to get your total current usage

<pre>current_usage = (plan_1_total_instances x plan_1_resources) + (plan_2_total_instances x plan_2_resources)</pre>


## <a id="backup"></a> Backing up Dedicated-VM and Shared-VM Instances

You can back up Redis for PCF instances in two ways for Dedicated-VM and Shared-VM instances:

+ Configure automatic backups to be run for each instance, across both service plans. For information about setting up automatic backups, see [Configuring Automated Backups](./auto-backup.html).
+ Create manual backups of individual instances. For information about how to make manual backups of instances, see [Manually Backing up and Restoring](./manual-br.html).

Backups are not available for On-Demand instances.


## <a id="metrics"></a> Monitoring Redis for PCF

### Redis Metrics

Redis for PCF emits Redis metrics via the firehose. For details, see [Monitoring and Metrics](./monitoring.html).


Metrics are not currently available at the instance-level for On-Demand instances.

### Logging

Syslog can be forwarded to an external log service.

Syslog for On-Demand instances conforms to RFC5424 standards. This format is as follows:

<pre class=terminal>
<$PRI>$VERSION $TIMESTAMP $HOST $APP_NAME $PROC_ID $MSG_ID
[instance@47450 deployment="$DEPLOYMENT" group="$INSTANCE_GROUP"
 az="$AVAILABILITY_ZONE" id="$ID"] $MESSAGE`
</pre>

An example:
<pre class=terminal>
  <13>1 2017-03-28T15:20:31.490350+00:00 10.0.16.35 redis-server 4951 - [instance@47450 director="us-pws" deployment="service-instance_16c95f89-8d5a-4cb7-839d-79c5d026bd15" group="redis-instance" az="eu-west-1a" id="7f976f34-4105-4475-abbc-5df10e933cfa" ] User requested shutdown
</pre>

The following example shows syslogs for Dedicated-VM and Shared-VM instances:

<pre class=terminal>
Nov 15 17:05:01 10.0.24.10 audispd: [job=dedicated-node index=4]  node=7bfe8b1b-6c
fd-4d33-b704-c9214ce6bb3e type=USER_ACCT msg=audit(1479229501.290:86): pid=6655 ui
d=0 auid=4294967295 ses=4294967295 msg='op=PAM:accounting acct="root" exe="/usr/sbi
n/cron" hostname=? addr=? terminal=cron res=success'
</pre>

For information about how to set up syslog output, see [Configure Syslog Output](./installing.html#syslog).

##  <a id="downtime"></a> Downtime During Redeploys

Downtime is caused by a redeploy of the Redis tile. Here we attempt to clarify what changes will trigger a redeploy.

In Ops Manager, any field that changes the manifest will cause a redeploy of the Redis tile. Any property changes in ERT listed here will trigger downtime for the Redis On-Demand Broker. Note that this list is current at the time of writing (May 2017) but that dependencies with changing products mean that it will change.
<ul>
  <li>Consul Server Resource Config (..cf.consul\_server.ips)</li>
  <li>Runtime System Domain ($runtime.system\_domain)</li>
  <li>Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment” in ERT
(..cf.ha\_proxy.skip\_cert\_verify.value)</li>
  <li>Runtime Apps Domain ($runtime.apps\_domain)</li>
  <li>NATS Resource Config
(..cf.nats.ips)</li>
  <li>Service Networks in Ops Manager
($self.service\_network)</li>
</ul>


For Redis for PCF v1.8+, downtime for service instances will only occur once the Operator runs `upgrade-all-service-instances` BOSH errand after all tile upgrades have completed successfully. For Redis for PCF v1.7 and earlier, and the Dedicated-VM and Shared-VM Service in Redis for PCF v1.8 and v1.9, downtime is enforced as soon as the operator applies the referenced changes to ERT. Any changes to a field on the Redis tile, will cause BOSH to redeploy the legacy Redis Broker and the On-Demand Broker once `upgrade-all-service-instances` is run.

## <a id="keycount"></a> Redis Key Count and Memory Size

Redis can handle up to 2<sup>32</sup> keys, and was tested in practice to handle at least 250 million keys per instance.
Every hash, list, set, and sorted set, can hold 2<sup>32</sup> elements.
VM memory is more likely to be a limiting factor than number of keys that can be handled.


##  <a id="smoke"></a>Smoke Tests

Ops Manager runs Redis for PCF smoke tests as a post-install errand.  The operator can also run the smoke tests errand by using `bosh run errand smoke-tests`. For more information see [Redis for PCF Smoke Tests](./smoke-tests.html).
