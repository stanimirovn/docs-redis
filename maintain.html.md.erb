This topic is for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) operators.
It introduces some best practices, but does not provide details about operation.


## <a id="Best Practice"></a>Best Practices

Pivotal recommends that operators follow these guidelines:

* **Resource Allocation**---Work with app developers to anticipate memory requirements and to configure VM sizes.
    Instances of Dedicted-VM and Shared-VM services have identical VM sizes.
    However, with the On-Demand service, app developers can choose from three different plans, each with its own VM size and quota.
    See the service offering for the [On-Demand Plan](./architecture.html) and [Resource Usage Planning for On-Demand plans](./architecture.html#resource).
* **Logs**---Configure a syslog output.
    Storing logs in an external service helps operators debug issues both current and historical.
    See [Configure Syslog Output](./installing.html#syslog).
* **Monitoring**---Set up a monitoring dashboard for metrics to track the health of the installation.
* **Backing Up Data**---When using Redis for persistence, configure automatic backups so that data can be restored in an emergency.
    Validate the backed-up data with a test restore.
    See [Configuring Automated Backups](./auto-backup.html) and [Manually Backing Up and Restoring Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/360002282154).
* **Using**---Instances of the On-Demand and Dedicated-VM services run on dedicated VMs.
    Apps in production should have a dedicated or on-demand instance to prevent performance issues caused by sharing an instance.
    The Shared-VM service shares a VM across many instances,
    and Pivotal recommends that you only use it for development and testing.
    See the service offerings for the [On-Demand Plan](./architecture.html) and the [Dedicated and Shared Plans](./architecture-pp.html).

## <a id="keycount"></a> Redis Key Count and Memory Size

Redis can handle up to 2<sup>32</sup> keys, and was tested in practice to handle at least 250 million keys per instance.
Every hash, list, set, and sorted set, can hold 2<sup>32</sup> elements.
VM memory is more likely to be a limiting factor than number of keys that can be handled.

## <a id="errands"></a>Errands

Redis for PCF includes the errands listed below.

### <a id="post-deploy"></a> Post-Deploy Errands

* **Broker Registrar**---Registers the cf-redis-broker with PCF to offer the `p-redis` service (`shared-vm` and `dedicated-vm` plans).
  As of Redis for PCF v1.14 this disables service access to the `dedicated-vm` plan for non-admin app developers.

* **Remove Deprecated Functionality**--- Disables service access to the `dedicated-vm` plan for non-admin app developers. Available as of Redis for PCF v1.14.

* **Smoke Tests**---Runs lifecycle tests for `shared-vm` and `dedicated-vm` plans if these have been enabled and there is remaining quota available.
    The tests cover provisioning, binding, reading, writing, unbinding, and deprovisioning of service instances.

* **Register On-Demand Broker**---Registers the on-demand Redis broker with PCF to offer the `p.redis` service (on-demand plans).

* **On-Demand Smoke Tests**---Runs lifecycle tests for enabled plans of the `p.redis` service if there is remaining quota available.
    The tests cover provisioning, binding, reading, writing, unbinding and deprovisioning of service instances.

* **Upgrade All On-Demand Service Instances**---Upgrades on-demand service instances to use the latest plan configuration, service releases, and stemcell.

The above post-deploy errands are run by default whenever **Apply Changes** is triggered,
whether or not there has been a configuration change in the Redis for PCF tile itself.

### <a id="pre-delete"></a> Pre-Delete Errands

* **Broker Deregistrar**---Deregisters the `cf-redis-broker`.

* **Delete All On-Demand Service Instances and Deregister Broker**---Deletes all on-demand instances and deregisters the on-demand Redis broker.

The above pre-delete errands are run by default whenever the Redis for PCF tile is deleted.

### <a id="turning-off"></a> Turning off Post-Deploy Errands

Pivotal recommends that you run the post-deploy errands at any trigger of **Apply Changes**.
However, this practice can extend the duration of applying changes by several minutes every time.
This section helps you decide when it is safe to skip some post-deploy errands.

#### Changes to Redis for PCF Tile Configuration

If the changes include configuration changes on the Redis for PCF tile or a new stemcell version, the operator must run all post-deploy errands.

#### Installing Another Tile

When installing another tile that does not make any changes to the BOSH Director
or the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) or Elastic Runtime tile,
it is not necessary to run any of the Redis for PCF tile's post-deploy errands.

#### Changes to Other Tiles

Sometimes the change does not include changes to the Redis for PCF tile's configuration.
Then it might not be necessary to run all of the Redis for PCF tile's post-deploy errands.

#### Broker Registrar Errand

- Required to run if the CF system domain is changed in the PAS (or Elastic Runtime) tile.
- Not necessary to run if the change only involves other tiles except PAS (or Elastic Runtime) tile.

#### Remove Deprecated Functionality

- Only needs to be run once to disable service access to the `dedicated-vm` plan for non-admin app developers.

#### Register On-Demand Broker Errand

- Required to run if the network range that the Redis On-demand Broker is deployed in is changed in the BOSH Director tile.
- Not necessary to run if the change only involves other tiles except BOSH Director.

<p class="note">
Pivotal <a href="./upgrade.html#network-upgrades">recommends</a> against changing the BOSH Director's network configuration
in a way that changes the ranges where the Redis for PCF tile deploys VMs.
</p>

#### Smoke Tests and On-Demand Smoke Tests Errands

- Required to run if their respective register broker errand is required.
- Required to run both if a newer stemcell minor version is uploaded.
  The Redis for PCF tile floats to the newest minor version.
  For more information, see [Understanding Floating Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/understanding-stemcells.html).
- Good practice to run both for any change in the BOSH Director or PAS (or Elastic Runtime) tile.
- Not necessary to run either if the change only involves other tiles except PAS (or Elastic Runtime) and BOSH Director.

#### Upgrade All On-Demand Service Instances Errand

- Required to run if a newer stemcell minor version is uploaded.
  The Redis for PCF tile floats to the newest minor version.
  For more information, see [Understanding Floating Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/understanding-stemcells.html).
- Not necessary to run if there are no on-demand instances provisioned.

##  <a id="smoke"></a>Smoke Tests

Ops Manager runs Redis for PCF smoke tests as a post-install errand.
You can also run the smoke tests errand using the following procedure:

1. Retrieve the deployment name of the installed product. To find the deployment name, do the following steps:
  1. From the Ops Manager UI, click the Redis for PCF tile.
  1. Copy the part of the URL that starts with "p-redis-".

1. Run the smoke tests errand: <br>
`bosh -d REDIS-DEPLOYMENT-NAME run-errand smoke-tests`

For more information, see [Redis for PCF Smoke Tests](./smoke-tests.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Smoke tests fail unless you enable global default application security groups (ASGs).
   You can enable global default ASGs by binding the ASG to the <code>system</code> org without specifying a space.
   To enable global default ASGs, use <code>cf bind-running-security-group</code>.</p>
