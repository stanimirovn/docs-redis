## <a id="1100"></a> v1.10.0

**Release Date: October 10, 2017**

### Features

* Includes metrics for the on-demand service. This enables operators to monitor the health of their Redis instances.

* Introduces a new format for on-demand metrics. This is the standard format for all services and will eventually replace other formats.

* Uses a new release for syslog that allows the operator to configure the log format to be either the pre-existing one or RFC5424. RFC5424 is the standard format for PCF services. The previous format will eventually be deprecated.

* Enables TLS encryption for syslog forwarding.

* Lua Scripting defaults to off for all on-demand service plans. Pivotal's security recommendation is to keep Lua Scripting as off.

* Allows the operator to opt-out of the on-demand service without configuring on-demand plans.

### Known Issues

* `lua-timeout-limit`, a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developers through arbitrary parameters, does not have any effect due to a bug in Redis v3.2.8.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on 12345. This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has [unexpected behavior](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html) in what changes trigger the errand. Do not select this option for errands.

* Logs for service-backup and service-metrics releases are truncated when syslog is not configured.
