## Redis for PCF v1.8.7
**November 9, 2017**

**Compatibility**

* Uses Redis OS 3.2.11

**Known Issues**

* The redis-odb service broker listens on `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has [unexpected behavior](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html). Do not select this choice as an errand.


## Redis for PCF v1.8.6
**September 22, 2017**

**Bug Fixes**

* Lua Scripting is disabled by default for the on-demand service. It was previously enabled by default. Pivotal recommends that Lua Scripting be disabled.

* Allows for the on-demand broker resource to be set to 0 or 1. This eases the ability of Operators to avoid setting up the on-demand service.

**Compatibility**

* Compatible with stemcells of 3445.11+

**Known Issues**

* `lua-timeout-limit`, a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developers through arbitrary parameters in v1.9,  does not have any effect due to a bug in Redis v3.2.8.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has [unexpected behavior](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html). Do not select this choice as an errand.

* Logs for service-backup and service-metrics releases are truncated when syslog is not configured.


## Redis for PCF v1.8.5
**August 29, 2017**

**Bug Fixes**

* Ensures all eviction policies are enforced when on-demand instance  memory is full.

**Compatibility**

* Uses On-Demand Service Broker v0.17.0


**Known Issues**

* The on-demand broker cannot be set to 0. This means that the instructions for disabling the on-demand service cannot be followed.

* `lua-timeout-limit`, a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developers through arbitrary parameters in v1.9,  does not have any effect due to a bug in Redis v3.2.8.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior. Do not select this choice as an errand.

* Logs for service-backup and service-metrics releases are truncated when syslog is not configured.


## Redis for PCF v1.8.4
**July 20, 2017**

**Bug Fixes**

* On-demand service instances correctly pick up new Redis releases and stemcells when upgraded. This addresses a prior bug where pre-existing instances were not upgrading Redis Releases or Stemcells.

* On-demand smoke tests are skipped if the quota for on-demand service instances has been met. This addresses a prior bug where the smoke tests would fail if the quota had been met.

* Includes a bug fix in the control script for process-destroyer which prevents process-watcher from restarting periodically (every 10,000 seconds).


**Known Issues**

* The on-demand broker cannot be set to 0. This means that the instructions for disabling the on-demand service cannot be followed.

* `lua-timeout-limit` a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developers through arbitrary parameters in v1.9,  do not have any effect due to a bug in Redis v3.2.8.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior. Do not select this choice as an errand.

* On-demand instances may not correctly enforce eviction policies when memory is full.



## Redis for PCF v1.8.2
**June 1, 2017**

**Compatibility**

* This release is compatibles with Stemcells 3363.24+.

**Features**

* Requires 2048-bit certificate length on Dedicated VMs.

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixes a bug in v1.8.1 where the Dedicated-VM service experiences periodic restarts.

* Fixes the formatting for the new on-demand service in Apps Manager.

* Allows for Redis backups to all AWS S3 regions.

**Known Issues**

* The on-demand broker cannot be set to 0. This means that the instructions for disabling the on-demand service cannot be followed.

* A bug exists in the control script for process-destroyer which causes process-watcher to restart periodically (every 10,000 seconds). The bug won't cause problems outside of making it more difficult to distinguish real issues reported by monit.

* New on-demand service instances do not pick up new stemcells beyond 3363.24.

* Upgrades of on-demand service instances from v1.8.0 and v1.8.1 to v1.8.2 do not take effect.

* `lua-timeout-limit`, a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developers through arbitrary parameters in v1.8,  do not have any effect due to a bug in Redis v3.2.8.

* Redis smoke tests fail if the number of instances of a certain plan have reached the global quota. Either remove the smoke tests errand or increase your quota.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior. Do not select this choice as an errand.

* On-demand instances may not correctly enforce eviction policies when memory is full.

**Known Issues**

* The on-demand broker cannot be set to 0. This means that the instructions for disabling the on-demand service cannot be followed.

* A bug exists in the control script for process-destroyer which causes process-watcher to restart periodically (every 10,000 seconds). The bug won't cause problems outside of making it more difficult to distinguish real issues reported by monit.

## Redis for PCF v1.8.0
**May 5, 2017**

**Compatibility**

* This release is compatible with PCF v1.9+.

* Includes Redis v3.2.8.

* The redis-broker now listens on port `12350`.

* The on-demand Service leverages the [On-Demand Broker v0.15.2](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/0-15/release-notes.html)

* TLS is turned on for metric communications.

* All Redis instances now have a consul agent co-located for service discovery and DNS. This means instances need to be able to listen on `8301`.

* For the on-demand service, the on-demand Service broker needs to talk to `bosh director`. This requires firewall rules to open TCP `8443` and `25555`.

**Known Issues**

* The on-demand broker cannot be set to 0. This means that the instructions for disabling the on-demand service cannot be followed.

* New on-demand service instances do not pick up new stemcells beyond the one they were installed with.

* `lua-timeout-limit` a Redis configuration that is exposed to app developers through arbitrary parameters in v1.8,  do not have any effect due to a bug in Redis v3.2.8.

* Redis smoke tests fail if the number of instances of a certain plan have reached the global quota. Either remove the smoke tests errand or increase your quota.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior. Do not select this choice as an errand and should change the defaults from 'When Changed' to 'On'

* Redis backups to AWS S3 are limited to standard region. Backups are only sent to AWS S3 buckets that have been created in the [US Standard region] (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region), “us-east-1.”

* Fails to install if a hostname has been configured for the Director in Ops Manager.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services.

* On-demand instances may not correctly enforce eviction policies when memory is full.
