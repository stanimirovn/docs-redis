## <a id="1121"></a> v1.12.1

**Release Date: May 24, 2018**

### Minor Features

* Permissions are stricter for service-related files and directories,
specifically those relating to the `redis.conf` and Redis `pid` files.

* Updates service display name for On-Demand Redis Service to "Redis On-Demand"
in the Apps Manager marketplace.

### Fixes

* Fixes an intermittent issue that can cause executing a restore to fail.

* It is now possible to update the arbitrary parameters of a service instance in an `update-service` command.

* Upgrades and stemcell bumps no longer fail with unresponsive or down shared-vms.

### Known Issues

* The `redis-odb` service broker listens on port `12345`.
This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behavior.
Do not select this choice as an errand run-rule.
For more information about this unexpected behavior, see
[Errand Run Rules](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html#run-rules).

* AOF rewrite does not occur in drain script for shared-vms.

## <a id="1120"></a> v1.12.0

**Release Date: April 24, 2018**

### Features

* Updates the packaged OSS Redis version to v4.0.8. 
For more information about new features in Redis v4.0.8, see the 
[Redis release notes](http://download.redis.io/redis-stable/00-RELEASENOTES).

* Introduces an experimental feature for on-demand instances that allows a Redis 
instance to be shared with another space.
For more information on this feature, see 
[Sharing a Redis Instance with Another Space (Beta)](./using.html#sharing).

* There is no longer a limit on the maximum number of on-demand instances that 
can be deployed from the Redis for PCF tile.

* The Redis append-only file is optimized for size when Redis restarts for more efficient disk usage.

* Tile deployment no longer fails if there are no shared system domains because
smoke tests now use the system domain.

* Supports stemcells without Transparent Huge Pages (THP) kernel modules.

* Reintroduces colocated errands for faster deployments.

### Known Issues

* The redis-odb service broker listens on port `12345`.
This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has unexpected behaviour.
Do not select this choice as an errand run-rule.
For more information about this unexpected behaviour, see
[Errand Run Rules](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html#run-rules).

* The redis-odb fails if arbitrary parameters are changed in an `update-service` command.

* Executing a restore may fail to complete and leave the CONFIG command unaliased.

* Running upgrades and stemcell bumps will fail if any shared-vms are down or unresponsive

* AOF rewrite does not occur in drain script for shared-vms.
