## <a id="1110"></a> v1.12.0

**Release Date: March 29, 2018**

### Features

* Redis version packaged has been updated to 4.0.8,
see [Redis release notes](http://download.redis.io/redis-stable/00-RELEASENOTES) for more details on features introduced.

* Experimental feature added to on demand instances to allow sharing a redis instance with another space.
See [Sharing the redis instance with another space](./using.html#sharing) for more information on the feature.

* Removed limit on the maximum number of on-demand instances that can be deployed from the tile.

* The Redis Appendonly File is optimised for size upon Redis restart for more efficient disk usage.

* Tile deployment no longer fails if there are no shared system domains. Smoke tests now push test apps to a space called `pivotal-services` in the `system` org using the system domain.

* Support stemcells without thp kernel modules.

* Collocated errands added back in for faster deployments.

\* As of PCF v2.0, _Elastic Runtime_ is renamed _Pivotal Application Service (PAS)_.

### Known Issues

* The redis-odb service broker listens on 12345. This is inconsistent with other services.

* The **When Changed** option for errands has [unexpected behavior](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html) in what changes trigger the errand. Do not select this option for errands.
