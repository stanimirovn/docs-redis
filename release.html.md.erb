## Redis for PCF v1.8.4
**July 20, 2017**

**Bug Fixes**

* On-Demand Service instances will correctly pick up new Redis releases and stemcells when upgraded. This addresses a prior bug where pre-existing instances were not upgrading Redis Releases or Stemcells.

* On-Demand smoketests will be skipped if the quota for on-demand service instances has been met. This addresses a prior bug where the smoketests would fail if the quota had been met.

* Includes a bug fix in the control script for process-destroyer which prevents process-watcher from restarting periodically (every 10,000 seconds).


**Known Issues**

* `lua-timeout-limit` a Redis configuration that is exposed to App Developers through arbitrary Parameters in 1.9,  will not have any effect due to a bug in Redis 3.2.8.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services and will be addressed in a future release.

* The 'When Changed' option for errands has unexpected behavior. Operators should not select this choice as an errand.

* On-Demand instances may not correctly enforce eviction policies when memory is full.



## Redis for PCF v1.8.2
**June 1, 2017**

**Compatibility**

* This release is compatibles with Stemcells 3363.24+.

**Features**

* Requires 2048-bit certificate length on Dedicated VMs.

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixes a bug in 1.8.1 where the Dedicated-VM service will experience periodic restarts.

* Fixes the formatting for the new on-demand service in Apps Manager.

* Allows for Redis backups to all AWS S3 regions.

**Known Issues**

* A bug exists in the control script for process-destroyer which causes process-watcher to restart periodically (every 10,000 seconds). The bug won't cause problems outside of making it more difficult to distinguish real issues reported by monit.

* New on-demand service instances will not pick up new stemcells beyond 3363.24.

* Upgrades of on-demand service instances from 1.8.0 and 1.8.1 to 1.8.2 will not take effect.

* `lua-timeout-limit`, a Redis configuration that is exposed to App Developers through arbitrary Parameters in 1.8,  will not have any effect due to a bug in Redis 3.2.8.

* Redis smoke tests will fail if the number of instances of a certain plan have reached the global quota. Either remove the smoke tests errand or increase your quota.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services and will be addressed in a future release.

* The 'When Changed' option for errands has unexpected behavior. Operators should not select this choice as an errand.

* On-Demand instances may not correctly enforce eviction policies when memory is full.

**Known Issues**

* A bug exists in the control script for process-destroyer which causes process-watcher to restart periodically (every 10,000 seconds). The bug won't cause problems outside of making it more difficult to distinguish real issues reported by monit.

* New on-demand service instances will not pick up new stemcells beyond 3363.20.

* Upgrades of on-demand service instances from 1.8.0 to 1.8.1 will not take effect.

* `lua-timeout-limit`, a Redis configuration that is exposed to App Developrs through arbitrary Parameters in 1.8,  will not have any effect due to a bug in Redis 3.2.8.

* Redis smoke tests will fail if the number of instances of a certain plan have reached the global quota. Either remove the smoke tests errand or increase your quota.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services and will be addressed in a future release.

* The 'When Changed' option for errands has unexpected behavior. Operators should not select this choice as an errand.

* On-Demand instances may not correctly enforce eviction policies when memory is full.


## Redis for PCF v1.8.0
**May 5, 2017**

**Compatibility**

* This release is compatible with PCF 1.9+.

* Includes Redis 3.2.8.

* The redis-broker now listens on port `12350`.

* The On-Demand Service leverages the [On-Demand Broker v0.15.2](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/0-15/release-notes.html)

* TLS is turned on for metric communications.

* All Redis instances now have a consul agent co-located for service discovery and DNS. This means instances need to be able to listen on `8301`.

* For the on-demand service, the on-demand Service broker needs to talk to `bosh director`. This requires firewall rules to open TCP `8443` and `25555`.

**Known Issues**

* New on-demand service instances will not pick up new stemcells beyond the one they were installed with.

* `lua-timeout-limit` a Redis configuration that is exposed to App Developrs through arbitrary Parameters in 1.8,  will not have any effect due to a bug in Redis 3.2.8.

* Redis smoke tests will fail if the number of instances of a certain plan have reached the global quota. Either remove the smoke tests errand or increase your quota.

* The 'When Changed' option for errands has unexpected behavior. Operators should not select this choice as an errand and should change the defaults from 'When Changed' to 'On'

* Redis backups to AWS S3 are limited to standard region. Backups are only sent to AWS S3 buckets that have been created in the [US Standard region] (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region), “us-east-1.”

* Fails to install if a hostname has been configured for the Director in Ops Manager.

* The redis-odb service broker listens on `12345`. This is inconsistent with other services and will be addressed in a future release.

* On-Demand instances may not correctly enforce eviction policies when memory is full.
