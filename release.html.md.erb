**Release Date: 06 27, 2020**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

1) Operators can select TLS versions for On-Demand Service Instances when TLS is enabled. After selecting a TLS version,
 we would recommend generating a new service key to reflect the updated TLS versions and rebinding the service instance
 with the new service key. Before doing this, ensure that you have followed the steps in Preparing for TLS and Network
 configuration.
2) Operators can install only Healthwatch 1.8 and above to be used with the redis tile.
