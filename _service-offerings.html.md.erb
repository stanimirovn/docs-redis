Redis for PCF v2.0 and later offers On-Demand and Shared-VM services.

* **On-Demand Service**---Provides a dedicated VM running a Redis instance.
  The operator can configure up to three plans with different configurations,
  memory sizes, and quotas.
  App developers can provision an instance for any of the On-Demand plans offered
  and configure certain Redis settings.

* **Shared-VM Service**---Provides support for a number of Redis instances running
  in a single VM.
  It is designed for testing and development purposes only, **do not use the
  Shared-VM service in production environments**.
  The Shared-VM instances are pre-provisioned by the operator with a fixed number
  of instances and memory size.
  App developers can then use one of these pre-provisioned instances.

* **(Deprecated) Dedicated-VM Service**---Historically used to provide a dedicated VM running a Redis instance.
  The Dedicated-VM Service was pre-provisioned by the operator with a fixed number
  of VMs and memory size. App developers could then use one of those pre-provisioned VMs.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Dedicated-VMs have been completely removed in v2.0.
      As of v1.11, the on-demand service is at feature parity with the Dedicated-VM service.
      As of v1.14, the on-demand service is marked as deprecated and migration to on-demand is heavily encouraged.
      Pivotal heavily recommends that you migrate to the on-demand service plan to prevent data loss.
